# GECG-Legacy-Project
An Initative by the students of college GEC-Gandhinagar.

We are the innovators or thats what I would love to say but the truth is we are just copying what we saw around in the industry.
But during the process of copying I saw the things that this project has taught me and these were the skills that the industry required, So now this is a college wide project with a simple goal, "Learn, teach and have fun".
